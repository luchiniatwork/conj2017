## Getting Started

You can start the server via `lein` with:

    $ lein run

Or directly with Java from the `jar`:

    $ lein uberjar
    $ cd target/
    $ java -jar e-commerce-demo.jar

You should see the server initializing and ready:

```
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - jetty-9.4.0.v20161208
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.ContextHandler - Started o.e.j.s.ServletContextHandler@6e892437{/,null,AVAILABLE}
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.AbstractConnector - Started ServerConnector@5a208e17{HTTP/1.1,[http/1.1, h2c]}{0.0.0.0:3000}
[main] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @17352ms
```

Open another terminal and fire a simple query against the server:

    $ curl localhost:3000/graphql -X POST -H "content-type: application/graphql" -d '{ products { name } }'

You should see a JSON response with all the products in the demo DB.

Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql) and you will see graphiQL's interface.

## More Details

### Component Architecture

This implementation follows the component/reloaded approach. The system is defined at
`e-commerce-demo.application`

### Reloading and Working on the REPL

When you initialize a REPL, you'll be in the `user` namespace by default. Over there you
can fire the whole system with `(go)`. `(stop)` and `(start)` are also available as well as
`(reset)` and `(reset-all)`. These should give you directly access to reload the system during
development.

### App Settings

The default port is `3000` but this can be changed in `e-commerce-demo.config`.

### Modelling

The schema is defined in `resources/schemas/e-commerce.umlaut`.
It is defined using [Umlaut](http://github.com/workco/umlaut).

### Resolvers

Resolvers are aggregated via `e-commerce-demo.resolvers.core`.

### Want to bootstrap a similar project?

This project was created using the [Justworks](https://github.com/workco/justworks) lein template.
